<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A spicy chicken and pesto pasta dish that's easy to adjust to any heat level. I created it after eating a similar dish
at a Santa Monica restaurant, and it's one of my favorites. Serve with additional grated Parmesan, if desired. As an
option, it's delicious with creamy goat cheese stirred in at the end.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons prepared basil pesto</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped coriander</li>    
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place farfalle pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al
    dente, and drain.</li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in the chile paste and chicken. Cook and stir chicken 10
    minutes, or until evenly browned and juices run clear.</li>
